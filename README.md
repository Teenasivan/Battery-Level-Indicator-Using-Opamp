We designed a simple 12V battery level indicator using the 4Ã—LM741 OpAmp. The circuit, comprising resistors, LEDs, and a Zener diode, effectively shows the battery's charge state with LEDs. This project demonstrates a practical approach to battery monitoring, suitable for applications without complex management systems, and can be easily adapted for different voltage ranges and improved for accuracy.
