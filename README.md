In this project, we built a simple circuit to check how much charge is left in a 12V battery using four LM741 operational amplifiers. These op-amps were used as comparators that compare the battery voltage with fixed reference voltages made using a Zener diode and resistors. As the battery voltage changes, the op-amps light up LEDs depending on the level of charge â€“ more LEDs mean more charge. We used voltage divider techniques to scale down the battery voltage for accurate comparison. This project helps us understand how basic electronic components like op-amps, resistors, and LEDs can be used together to monitor battery health in devices like UPS systems, car batteries, and solar energy storage units.
